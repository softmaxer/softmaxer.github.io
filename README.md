# My portfolio

This is my main repo for my portfolio built in NextJS and Tailwind.

## Why NextJS?

Originally, I just wanted to make this with HTMX, with Go as a templating backend. But I recently got introduced to Vercel because of work and I decided to learn a "Real" frontend framework, so I went ahead with NextJS

Honestly, turns out this is not such a bad option, I'm actually starting to like it.
